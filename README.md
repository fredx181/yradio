Internet Radio Player

Much inspired by PMRP from misko_2083, see:  
http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=963382#963382  
Took as a base concept for this from: Victor Ananjevsky's (yad author) "find frontend" example from here:  
https://sourceforge.net/p/yad-dialog/wiki/Frontend%20for%20find%2Bgrep%20commands/?limit=50  

Depends on **yad** (version 0.35 or higher) and **mplayer** installed.  

Search option has access to large database from "RadioSure" (commercial M$ app) converted to use with this app.
(need to click 'Update Index' first)  
- Ability to rip the stream (requires "streamripper" installed)
